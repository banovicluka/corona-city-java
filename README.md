# Corona city

In this JavaFX application, the operation of a population monitoring system in the city of CoronaCity after the appearance of the dangerous JavaKov-20 virus is simulated. The population is divided into three groups: children, adults, and seniors, each with a specific movement schedule based on their characteristics. Checkpoints read the temperature of individuals, while ambulance vehicles transport infected persons. The monitoring system is implemented as a GUI application with features for tracking population movements, managing ambulances, and displaying statistical data. In this application, there is a grid that represents possible tracks. Every person is a thread and moves on its track. Persons can not collide. At the end of the simulation, the results are recorded in a text file.
